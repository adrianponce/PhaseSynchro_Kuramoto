Content:
- PhaseStatistics_PLoS_share.m :  calculates the phase statistics of the fMRI data (phase locking matrix (PLV), the distribution of phase differences, the order parameter, intrinsic frequencies, etc.)
- Kuramoto_model_share.m : models the data using the Kuramoto model (calculates the fit between the PLV given by the model vs. the empirical PLV).
